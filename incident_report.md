# Incident Report – Treasury Breach  #

By 06:00 AM, Treasury staff reported a missing balance of ₹50 Crores (~$6 Million USD). No signs of forced entry were discovered. Physical locks, vault access controls, and external network defenses showed no breach.

Instead, the evidence strongly suggests the funds were siphoned internally using legitimate credentials and security layers: 
1. Badge authentication
2. Transaction Authorization Code
   
These controls were bypassed in sequence, which implies insider knowledge and collusion.

There were 10 employees inside the premises during the time of the heist and so it is being treated as an inside operation.


## Guidance for Investigators ##

- Treat this as the starting point of the investigation.
- Cross-verification with supporting evidence in other files will be required to establish accountability.

Further repositories will provide deeper technical data for analysis.
