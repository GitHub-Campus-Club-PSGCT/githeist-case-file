Subject: Treasury Breach – Initial Suspicions


After reviewing CCTV, badge logs, and communications, we conclude that:
Rizvi’s email (“Delivery confirmed tonight”) aligns directly with the time of the breach.
Vishal mounted multiple USB drives on servers, suggesting possible tool or malware installation.
Shaswanth’s presence on Treasury CCTV cannot be explained by his IT maintenance schedule.
Thejas’s badge activity suggests cloned or shared access.

Preliminary assessment:
Rizvi likely orchestrated communications with external actors.
Vishal facilitated data transfer tools via USB.


Recommendation: Immediate suspension of Rizvi and Vishal pending further review.
