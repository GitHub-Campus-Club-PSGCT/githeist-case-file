# Incident Report – Treasury Breach  #

By 06:00 AM, Treasury staff reported a missing balance of ₹50 Crores (~$6 Million USD). No signs of forced entry were discovered. Physical locks, vault access controls, and external network defenses showed no breach.

Instead, the evidence strongly suggests the funds were siphoned internally using legitimate credentials and security layers: 
1. Employee badge authentication
2. Dynamic OTP generated on the CFO’s terminal 
3. Hardware USB token authorization These controls were bypassed in sequence, which implies insider knowledge and collusion.

There were 10 employees inside the premises during the time of the heist and so it is being treated as an inside operation.

Law enforcement and forensic partners are engaged in the ongoing investigation.

The Treasury breach is treated as a deliberate, coordinated act by insiders. TechSphere will take all measures to safeguard its financial systems, restore trust, and ensure accountability. — TechSphere Corporate Management.
