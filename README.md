Night of the Heist - Management's Official Statement

On the night of September 4, at approximately 00:03 AM, the Treasury System at TechSphere Corporation experienced a brief disruption. At the time, this anomaly was dismissed by security as a minor glitch.

By 06:00 AM, Treasury staff reported a missing balance of ₹50 Crores (~$6 Million USD). No signs of forced entry were discovered. Physical locks, vault access controls, and external network defenses showed no breach.

Instead, the evidence strongly suggests the funds were siphoned internally using legitimate credentials and security layers:
1.Employee badge authentication
2.Dynamic OTP generated on the CFO’s terminal
3.Hardware USB token authorization
These controls were bypassed in sequence, which implies insider knowledge and collusion.


Preliminary reviews have raised concerns around the following employees:
Richitha – observed connecting a USB device to the CFO’s terminal near the breach window.
Vishal – found in possession of USB logs consistent with the Treasury activity.
Shaswanth – recorded near the Treasury wing during the time of the incident despite unrelated duties.
While other employees were present in the building, these individuals present the strongest correlation to the timeline of the theft.

TechSphere systems remain fundamentally secure; this incident stems from malicious insider actions, not external attackers.Immediate suspensions have been enacted for key suspects.Law enforcement and forensic partners are engaged in the ongoing investigation.

The Treasury breach is treated as a deliberate, coordinated act by insiders. TechSphere will take all measures to safeguard its financial systems, restore trust, and ensure accountability.
